# TodoList Backend API

This repository contains the backend API designed to handle the requests from the TodoList React application.

## Description

 The backend API provides endpoints for authentication using JWT (login and registration) and handles the manipulation of tasks within the application. The API includes the following functionalities:

- **Authentication:** Users can register new accounts and login using JWTs.
- **Task Management:** Users can retrieve tasks categorized as completed, irrelevant, and todo. Additionally, they can modify said tasks by editing their description, titles and deadlines as well as marking them as completed, or setting their relevance.
- **Task Addition:** The API also handles tasks addition.
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for specific tasks based on keywords.

## Getting Started

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the cloned repository directory.
4. To launch the API for the first time, execute the following command:
